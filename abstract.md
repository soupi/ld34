Welcome to <Company>.

For the past 20 our scientists and engineers have been working on a top secret project.

At last, they have succeeded in creating a marvelous machine, a computing machine.

We call it 'The Computing Machine'.

You had the fortune to be selected as one of the chosen few to operate The Computing Machine.

At <Company>, we have a lot of challenges waiting to be solved.

Fortunately for you, The Computing Machine is really simple to operate, it only has two buttons!

All you have to do is insert the right combination of the two buttons, and The Computing Machine will do the rest!

Good Luck!
